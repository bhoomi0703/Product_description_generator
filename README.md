# Product_description_generator

A product description generator is a tool that automatically creates written descriptions for products. These descriptions are typically used in e-commerce settings, online marketplaces, or product catalogs to provide information about the features, benefits, and characteristics of a product.

This product description generator is a simple example created using the Streamlit library for the user interface and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for basic natural language processing.

The project takes the product name and features as input, tokenizes the features, removes stop words, calculates the most frequent words, and generates a description using those words. The description is a formatted string combining the product name, the most common words, and the original features.
